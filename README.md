Zoltar--

To make it work, put the text files into a subdirectory called advice_fortunes/

The game asks the user to input 1,2 or 3 to choose from advice, a fortune, or lucky numbers.
It then displays the selected choice and prints out a random result depending on the choice.


Current errors----
The game continues even if 'n' is entered.
Need to reorganize code to allow loop of game without infinite loop.
